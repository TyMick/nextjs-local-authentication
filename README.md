# Next.js local authentication with MongoDB

This is the beginning stages of an app I'm building. While the app itself is half-finished, I figure this shell consisting of Next.js and local cookie-based authentication using bcrypt and MongoDB, all wrapped up in an adaptation of Creative Tim's [Paper Dashboard React](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-dashboard-react), is a satisfactory portfolio piece in the meantime.
